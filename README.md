# "AR Home"

This is the prototype Unity Project for the Engagement Lab's AR Home work on Hololens, a spin-off of _[AR Stories Hack Day](https://elab.emerson.edu/projects/ar_stories)_.

Borrows from Microsoft's [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) and [HoloLens Academy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/academy) code.

Thanks to Microsoft NERD for hardware donation and their [CSE team](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/CSE.html) for development support.
